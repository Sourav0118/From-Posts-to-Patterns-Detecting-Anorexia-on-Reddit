I am completing a project on the impact of the 14th amendment. Though I Have found a good deal relating the topic to the 1960\\'s civil rights movement and feminism, I\\'m struggling to connect it to the more modern gay right\\'s movement.\\n\\nI have cited Romer v.

Sorry for the mix-up, I know the difference but I\\'ll edit it!\\n\\nI think you have a good point as well!  how do you deal with veterans day?  *edit: i was referring to memorial day, but i suppose the question could be applied to either of days)\\n\\nAs someone against war, I feel extremely uncomfortable on this day. Though I don\\'t want to come off as pretentious and unthankful, I have a very hard time thanking people for inflicting such violence upon others. How do you respect veterans, while keeping pacifism in mind?     so many girls hate \"other girls\" based on untrue stereotypes\\n\\nits a neverending cycle of \"omg i no shallow and preppy and slutty like other girlssss\"     They didnt die from the heat?

Where is this place where no one acknowledges rape?     Its not a bad point, just poorly written.     What are they supposed to learn exactly?     so saying you\\'re support queers is \"trivializing their oppression,\" saying nothing is oppressing, and being against queers is oppressing?\\n\\n??? am i missing something here ???     i know a kid who saves stuff exactly like this to his iPad he brings to school, and then shows people and laughs hysterically.     I do the majority of times, yet being a white girl sometime I do get the urge for a frappuccino other than my usual dark roast. c:  paying .75 extra for soy milk  I understand a slightly higher price for soy milk, but up to 75 cents for a 1/2 cup in a latte? \\n\\n\\n...I do love Starbucks though, so I guess they get away with the rip-off.

I love the blush placement, very natural! I love the eye color, but I agree that the inner corner highlight is a bit too strong. I would also suggest going softer on the nose contour, or at least blending more...I can see the \"line,\" if that makes sense.     I feel torn about this. I was born in 1998, so have never been able to see Tool in concert.

Though no reason was given, I have a feeling that was why.\\nNow track is over, summer break is a few weeks away (June 5th), and my schedule is MUCH more open.

Outsider Even in Aspergers Community  Hi everyone, new poster. So...I\\'m a 17 year-old girl who was diagnosed professionally with Aspergers Syndrome.  I have always been very rigid in my schedules, bad coordination, depression and anxiety, and few friends. As a kid, I had very focused interests; now I have compulsive behaviors and thoughts, though I do not have OCD. Despite all these symptoms and an official diagnosis, I feel like a can\\'t relate to any other aspies.\\n\\n(Note: Please do not be offended, these are simply the binding interests of many aspies I know)\\nFor example, I don\\'t have an interest in anime, most cartoons, video games, transportation, or technology. Rather, my interests are sociology, political science, abnormal psychology, long-distance running, cycling, and makeup (a form of art i suppose). I\\'m sure I\\'m not alone, but I feel like I am. The group at my school is full of people I\\'m frankly intimidated by; they are loud, obsessed with MLP, and generally unpleasant to be around. Regular people don\\'t want to be with me because I\\'m too neurotic...\\n\\nSorry for the unstructured rant, I\\'m not in a great mood right now.\\n\\n     \"Don-Don\"     \"Donkey Punch the Night\" and \"C is for...\" are mine     Personally, Conditions of my Parole is my favorite, but Money Shot is fairly close. I just think Conditions is AMAZING, while I don\\'t really care for Galileo or Grand Canyon on the new album. The EPs have good songs too, but I tend not to like the remixes, For me, V is for Vagina only has about 5 songs I\\'d listen to...the rest kind of drone on.     Oy, I didn\\'t think about that to be honest...yeah, it does look like it was ripped off of something, not just picked up     The setlist has already been leaked; why do they care? I get not wanting people to, but kicking someone out for that is plain wrong, especially when you obviously are a huge fan.     I feel like they really didn\\'t communicate what was going on.vI\\'m sure they KNEW there wasn\\'t a real threat. I understand the need to follow protocol, but at least inform the people who paid a ton to go see. I went to the Marina   the Diamonds concert and didn\\'t have these problems...sad     I personally didn\\'t see any overt Tool fans, except for maybe a shirt...nothing yelled out like \"PLAY SOBER!\" However, I was right behind the dude who lit up s joint; they were hollering and dancing and staring everyone down for \"not getting into it.\" They were kicked out after the alarm; second half went by much smoother, obviously.     I love Gerard Cosmetic\\'s Cher and Colourpop\\'s Grunge personally.     Man, that\\'s a fair run time. Love it!     I used to listen to the Lateralus album on the bus. I don\\'t know if that\\'s \"impure,\" but i closed my eyes and just completely tuned out the background chatter. I didn\\'t do any wack transcending planes of consciousness, but I was able to enjoy the music on a deeper level than usual. You can do it anywhere if you\\'re focused enough.     i actually love thin lips! your features are very delicate and doll-like. personally, i\\'d love to do some dramatic lower lash looks; they look great on people with round, large eyes     oh my god! it feels odd saying this, but i just love freckles on east asians! i would really play up the freckles rather thasn try to cover them, and have some natural, straight brows     The left half and right half look like they belong to teo different palettes...peach and plum maybe?     I wish my dad was cool enough to accept Tool...he was shocked that I listen to metal. It seems so surreal to me, but that\\'s great!     I totally listen to Opiate and Undertow songs before cross country meets! Nice to see other runners on this subreddit  First Tool Song?  Not a complex question, but I\\'m wondering if anyone else has a memorable experience of how they first discovered Tool.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was a probably in 9th grade who was dragged to my parent\\'s friend\\'s silent auction. I got so bored that I hopped in the parked car and flipped through radio stations. I guess I stumbled upon an alternative rock station right as Parabola started playing. It was entrancing...I couldn\\'t define exactly what made the music so special, but I just lay back and tried to soak all the words in.  This sounds stupid, but at the time I feel like it was one of those \"aha\" moments. When I got home, I googled all the lyrics I remembered to find the song. Best decision I ever made.     I live in MN and don\\'t know of any radio station that plays Tool regularly...what station is it?     In addition, do they really expect people who own the CDs to never skip songs? There\\'s still track listings, and I think it\\'s a bit controlling to try and determine how customers view your art to such an extent. Listening to songs flow into another is very cool. but sometimes people really want to listen to a certain song. I don\\'t think that makes them any less of a fan.     I know I may get hate for this, but I really wish they\\'d do digital release on their music. I think the whole \"musical integrity\" argument is kind of silly...I would still listen to the albums in order if I had them on my iPhone, and it seems they\\'re fine with Pandora shuffling their music.

Thanks, I have done them better before but I had about 3 minutes to do them. I will keep it in mind next time though!     Very cool idea! If I had to give critique, I would use a deeper and darker blue as the base, then add fewer stars and highlights so the ones that are there really pop! Maybe tints of purple? I do like the variety in tones and the little nebula!

I have high-functioning autism and it makes my life more difficult, but I don\\'t think rejecting acceptance is bad...Autism Speaks is a bad organization, it does demonize autism in a hilariously exaggerated way.

Definitely a deal if you were going to spend over $25 at Sephora anyways :)     The Hetalia shirt confirms the cringe.      Wow! Your brows show a TON of improvement! Very cool     I gotta try that, sounds like a great way to get more out of some shadows you normally don\\'t use much!     A cool idea! I do have some tips that I think would help you obtain the look you are trying to achieve. Since fairies are not real, I am going off the image that comes to mind when I think of a fairy.\\n\\nFirst off, the things I like. The nose highlight! it really makes it look dainty and gives a nice glow. Your freckles are gorgeous and fit the fairy them, so I\\'d say don\\'t try to cover them up.  \\n\\nThe lipstick is too frosted and gets lost in with the rest of your skin. I think a nude or light pink gloss would add a bit of color without taking attention away from your eyes.\\n\\nThe brows are also a little too bold for a fairy\\'s. Fairies are wispy, airy; they flutter around and are weightless. Using less brow product and letting some individual hairs show will help. That doesn\\'t mean don\\'t do them at all, just go for a more natural look.\\n\\nThe eyeshadow is cool, but the yellow should be kept on your lid or lid to crease only as to minimize visual clutter. It will have more impact that way.  The eyeliner wing also is very dramatic, thick, and angled. This is really good for some looks, but doesn\\'t really fit in with this one.\\n\\nI hope this helps!     Insomnia on the liner was GENIUS. How did you get it on so precisely?     Ethan was such a cute little kid! And Sean looks...exactly the same.  I pay homage to Lateralus with my grad cap.       I am going to buy the \"anime was a mistake\" stickers in bulk and plaster them over the school\\'s manga club     The more pictures of Taro I see, the more I need it!     Yes...if you mean downstairs to the kitchen in order to eat Ben and Jerry\\'s heheh     Such a cool idea. Do you mind if I try it? Maybe with credit to your original post?     Has anyone ever found a similar product? It looks great but I don\\'t buy Maybelline.      Yeah man, I saw that too. I actually think part of it is due to me usually wearing crewnecks, where you can\\'t even see my collarbone. I will keep it in mind as summer progresses though!     Ahh, I get it. I guess I just see very few people with that problem, but I guess it\\'s nice they have options too. I just feel like it was being marketed to an audience much too broad.     **PRODUCTS USED**\\n\\n* Foundation: Bareminerals liquid foundation in 15\\n\\n* Bronzer: Too Faced Chocolate Soleil (used as more of a contour than bronzer)\\n\\n* Primer: Too Faced Primed and Poreless\\n\\n* Brows: Some UD dark brown eyeshadow...I don\\'t remember\\n\\n* Eye Primer: Kat von D\\'s Lock-it Eye Primer\\n\\n* Eyeshadow: Lime Crime\\'s Venus II palette, using mud on the crease and pigeon on the lid (I know LC has questionable business practices, but I already owned the palette)\\n\\n* Eyeliner: Kat von D\\'s Ink!

Do appreciate the innovate colors though...tired of brands coming out with the same mauve colors and acting like they reinvented the wheel.     I LOVE Kat Von D\\'s line generally, but I totally don\\'t understand the \"color-correcting eye primer.\" You are seriously putting color over it...just use a regular primer, it should be enough for all but a black eye.     I put on white instead of nude eyeliner on my waterline.  I just haven\\'t gotten around to buying any more, and white looks cool-not natural, but it does make your eyes look bigger. Since I don\\'t wear natural makeup anyways I don\\'t care.     You are super pretty, I ADORE the freckles! I would make the brows more feathery (brush out the powder/gel just a bit), and add some more depth by darkening the crease shades (though that is my personal style, i don\\'t go as natural as you lol).\\n\\nMy biggest CC would to add a light color on the waterline, would reslly pull the look together     Geez, you are adorable! Great blending too. I would bring the blush at an angle? It seems put on a bit too horizontally.     Bite Beauty\\'s matte lip pencil in Glac!     This is my first time trying it. Don\\'t think it will be a staple, but it is pretty cool-looking!     i adore tool AND an interested in anatomy, so it was a great buy     I will bet you my life\\'s savings it is on wine and Puscifer.      My eye makeup was done with...\\n\\n **Kat Von D High Voltage Primer**\\n\\n**Marc Jacobs Gel Liner** in black as a base for the shadow\\n\\n**Kat Von D\\'s Shade and Light Eye Palette**. Used the chocolate brown for a transition shade, and a matte black to deepen the black. Some of the lightest shade under my brow\\n\\n**Colourpop\\'s Liner in Swerve** on my inner rim  Embracing the Raccoon Eyeshadow Look       I\\'m sure it\\'s hard to come out of the closet, saying you like...conventionally attractive and famous women?     finally, someone who doesn\\'t snub undertow. i adore that album. \\n\\n1 2. Undertow and Lateralus (tied) It\\'s like apples to oranges...IMMENSELY different, but I love both. undertow appeals to my love of grunge, Lateralus really transports you to a different place.\\n\\n3. nima: Many of my favorite songs are on here, but I honestly am not a fan of the nihilistic theme, especially on the title song.\\n\\n4. 10,000 Days: Great work as usual, but too many filler songs. Rosetta Stoned is a banger though.     mandarin jarrito? ohhhhh it\\'s LIT     They look like pieces of printer paper colored with sharpies and highlighters     He is an utter idiot and coward, jesus     I don\\'t buy much high-end makeup that I regret, but I do regret a lot of my NYX stuff. Some of it is great, so that\\'s why I continue to buy the brand. Sadly, a lot absolutely sucks...\\n\\n* **NYX Liquid Suede in Vintage:** Just way too purple-toned, much more than it appeared in the tube. Smudges a lot and the paddle-applicator sucks. I also can\\'t get over the sticky texture and bad smell.\\n\\n* **NYX felt tip liner:** Oh god, worst pigmentation and ran out day one I used it. Stick with anything else...I was really looking forward to an affordable one, too.\\n\\n* **NYX Wonder Pencil:** Don\\'t bother using this on your waterline if you want it to stay more than 10 minutes. It comes off easily, has an overly-firm texture, and doesn\\'t blend well either.\\n\\n* **NYX Tres Jolie Liner:** It is good quality gel liner itself, but the sharpener doesn\\'t sharper. I honestly just broke the tip every time I tried to use it, no matter at what angle or pressure. Therefore, I either put the product onto another eyeliner tip or don\\'t use it at all.\\n\\n     Remember when she put a picture of her with a \"chocolate cherry\" color on her lips weeks back? I was dying in envy! I sure hope that is one of the official colors.     I almost screamed in excitement in class, hoooly crap I love the new corals and browns!     I actually like this picture.
